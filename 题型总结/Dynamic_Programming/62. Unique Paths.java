/* A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the 
bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28 */

class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] f = new int[m][n];
        f[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i > 0) {
                    f[i][j] += f[i - 1][j];
                }
                if (j > 0) {
                    f[i][j] += f[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return f[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
//time: O(n * m), space: O(n * m)
