/* Given an array of positive integers representing a stockâ€™s price on each day. On each day you can only make one operation: either buy or sell one unit of stock and you can make at most 1 transaction. Determine the maximum profit you can make.

Assumptions

The given array is not null and is length of at least 2.
Examples

{2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5}, the maximum profit you can make is 5 - 1 = 4 */
