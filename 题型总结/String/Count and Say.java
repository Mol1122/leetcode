/* Given a sequence of number: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, â€¦

The rule of generating the number in the sequence is as follow:

1 is "one 1" so 11.

11 is "two 1s" so 21.

21 is "one 2 followed by one 1" so 1211.

Find the nth number in this sequence.

Assumptions:

n starts from 1, the first number is "1", the second number is "11"
n is smaller than 30 */
